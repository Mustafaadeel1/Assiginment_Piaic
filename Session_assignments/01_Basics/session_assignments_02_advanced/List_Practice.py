#Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

#def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.
def main():
    # Correct way to define a list
    Li = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple']
    
    # Finding the length of the list
    length = len(Li)
    
    # Print the length of the list
    print("The length of the list is:", length)

# Call the main function
main()
