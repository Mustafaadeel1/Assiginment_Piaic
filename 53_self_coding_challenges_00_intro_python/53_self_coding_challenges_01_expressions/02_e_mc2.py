# Write a program that continually reads in mass from the user and then outputs the equivalent energy using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula (E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and C is the speed of light:

# E = m * c**2
m = 100.0
c = 299792458
E =  m * c**2
print(f"{E} Joules of energy  is equivalent to {m} kilograms of mass")
